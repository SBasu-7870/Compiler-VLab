Parse tree is a hierarchical structure which represents the derivation of the grammar to yield input strings. Parse trees are an in-memory representation of the input with a structure that conforms to the grammar. The advantages of using parse trees is that the parser can make multiple passes over the data without having to re-parse the input.",
